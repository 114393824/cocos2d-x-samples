    $ ./download-deps.py

### Running
    
Once the samples were downloaded just go any sample, and open the project. eg:

    $ cd cocos2d-x-samples/samples/LiquidFun-Testbed/proj.ios_mac
    $ open LiquidFun-Testbed.xcodeproj/


Available samples:

## LiquidFun

Based on [Box2d](box2d.org), [LiquidFun](http://google.github.io/liquidfun/) features particle-based fluid simulation. Game developers can use it for new game mechanics and add realistic physics to game play. Designers can use the library to create beautiful fluid interactive experiences.

We provide 2 samples:

### LiquidFun - Testbed

From [GAF](http://gafmedia.com/about) homepage:

_"GAF stands for Generic Animation Format. GAF is designed to store Flash animations in an open cross platform format for further playback in a multitude of game development frameworks and devices. GAF enables artists and animators to use Flash CS for creating complex animations and seamlessly use them with various game development frameworks."_

This sample shows how to use GAF with cocos2d-x. It has 5 different GAF samples and shows how to play sound events with GAF.

Supported platforms:

 - iOS
 - Android
